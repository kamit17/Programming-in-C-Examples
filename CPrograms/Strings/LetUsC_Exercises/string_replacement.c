/*Write a program that uses an array of pointers to strings str[ ]. Receive two strings str1 and str2 and check if str1 is embedded in any of the strings in str[ ]. If str1 is found, then replace it with str2.
char *str[ ] = {
"We will teach you how to...",
"Move a mountain",
"Level a building",
"Erase the past",
"Make a million",
"...all through C!"
} ;
For example if str1 contains "mountain" and str2 contains "car", then the second string in str should get changed to "Move a car".
